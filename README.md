# Basic_Chemistry_Calculations
This program allows the user to (a) find the molar mass of a compound, (b) find the number of moles in a compound, or (c) find the mass of a compound 

The user can first chose which calculation they want to have the computer complete, and based on their choice they may be prompted for more information (such as the mass of the compound). 
When asked for the elements in the compound, the user will have to enter each element seperatly as well as the quantity of that element present. 
For example, the compound of water (H2O) would have two H elements and one O element. 
The user will keep being prompted to enter more elements until they enter that they are done ("done", "no", or "n"). 
Once all of the necessary information has been obtained, calculations will be completed and the answer displayed.
